# Agrar.ai

## Description

Agrar.ai is an innovative web service designed to simplify the garbage collection and recycling process. The platform allows users to easily apply for garbage collection and farmers or receivers to collect and recycle it efficiently. One of the key features of Agrar.ai is the integration of artificial intelligence that uses a camera to help users identify the type of garbage, making it easier to sort and then recycle.

## Features

- **Applying for garbage collection:** User-friendly interface for quick application.
- **Indentifying garbage with AI:** Use your device's camera to identify the type of garbage.
- **Linking users and recyclers:** The platform connects people who want to dispose of garbage with farmers and receivers ready to pick it up.
- **Environmental Contribution:** Contribute to the environment by disposing of waste properly.

## Technology

- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS to create an interactive user interface.
